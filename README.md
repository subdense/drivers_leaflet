Now I have a map showing most of the variables as they enter the analysis for Strasbourg.
The current website is subdense_Strasbourg.html and uses the full strasbourg.js data.

I am not sure if seeing this last stage of the variables before they enter the analysis is what the reader wants or if it would be more relevant to see the raw data (i.e. the parks, the amenities, the landuse, the building footprints (they are probably too much to handle))

The website is a little bit slow but can handle the full grid dataframe for Strasbourg. Adding a split view with the other regions will probably make it crash.
