##Map visualizing variables for the Drivers Paper

This is a working example using only the Strasbourg case. Originally I used strasbourg.js as my data source but now, using the gridviz plugin, it goes much faster. The working .html is gridviz_plugin_strasbourg.html

To do:

- [ ] Remove scroll bar 
- [ ] Add grid outline
- [ ] Add sources
- [ ] Show densification as default layer
- [ ] Add case outline
- [ ] Experiment with split view
